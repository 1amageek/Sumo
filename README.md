# Sumo

Sumo is a library that prepares for fast upload for iOS.
It is effective when uploading by selecting images continuously.
Sumo will prepare for uploading immediately after the image is selected.
Multiple selected images are compiled into one file and compressed.
One compressed file can communicate without overhead.
